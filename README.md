- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickvd43
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data engineering and software development in Java and Python and in general learning 
      new skills (I'm so into development that I even love to develop my own skills)
- ðŸ¤“ I'm experienced in developing etl processes and backend features. I've worked with a ton of python and java libraries and I developed solutions in the cloud 
      using terraform, docker and kubernetes. I like to automate everything using CI/CD and I am familiar with several DBMS like MySQL, Cassandra and PostgreSQL 
      as well as stream processing using Apache Kafka.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the python fastAPI libary and Apache Airflow
